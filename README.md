# Boilerplate for React-Native with Expo and Typescript

This Boilerplate will give you a proper development environment with testing, linting, env configuration, type checking and CI support!

If you would like to know how i created this boilerplate or even want to create it yourself, please check out my blog post: https://medium.com/@ch1ll0ut1/how-to-setup-react-native-with-typescript-the-new-way-6c1f1cce6ed3

## How to use

### If you didnt install Expo yet, run:

`yarn global add expo-cli`

### To run the project
`yarn start`

This will open a new window with expo web interface and allow you to scan the qr code with your iphone camera or the expo android app which lets you open this react-native mobile app.

Now you can start editing files and the app will automatically refresh and show you your latest changes.

### Build
For build read more at the official expo documentation: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/distribution/building-standalone-apps

### Testing
`yarn test`

### Linting
`yarn lint`

### CI Validation
`yarn validate`
